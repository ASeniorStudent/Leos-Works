    <p>Here is an image from a simple click game from the bjc or “the Beauty and Joy of Computing” curriculum. Using block code, me and my teammate had to make this sprite disappear until it was completely gone every time you clicked.</p>

    <h2><a>Little Drummer</h2></a>
    <p>Here is an image that I made using python from the lessons provided from CMU CS Academy. It’s a bit difficult at first, but it gets a lot easier, although this is barely the beginning. .</p>

    <p> here’s a little hobby that me and 2 of my friends have decided to do. You could check it out if you want, although we mostly post whatever. You would have to sign in to instagram or make an account to see it though.</p>

    <h2>16 by 16 bit image</h2>
    <p> Here's a 16 by 16 bit image that I made using code.org's pixelation tool and binary. It's small but it is meant to be a campfire.</p>

    <p>Here is an image of a drawing app that I made with a partner for the congressional app challenge. It's mainly an shading app for images to import, however it is a work in progress. Click the title to find it.

    <h2><a href="https://edu.cospaces.io/Studio/Space/XfbQsFka7lRlCkTE">Beyblade Game</h2></a>
    <p>This was a project that me and another person had to make for the AP create Task. It's a fun little game that simulates a Beyblade Match in a game, though it currently can't actually function as a VR game.</p>
